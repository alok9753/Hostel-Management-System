# Hostel-Management-System
The Hostel Management System is a software application designed to manage hostel operations, including student room allocation, billing, and record keeping. Built using Java, this system automates the management of hostel facilities, providing an efficient way for hostel administrators to maintain student records, assign rooms, and handle payment transactions.

Features:

Student Registration: Allows the registration of students with personal and academic details for hostel accommodation.
Room Allocation: Manages room assignments and helps avoid double bookings by ensuring that each room is assigned only once.
Billing & Payment Management: Keeps track of student payments for hostel accommodation, including fees and payment status.
Search & Filter: Administrators can search for students or rooms based on various criteria such as name, room number, or payment status.
Reports: Generates reports on student occupancy, payments, and available rooms.
Admin Dashboard: A simple, user-friendly interface for administrators to manage the hostel operations efficiently.

Technologies Used:

Java for building the application and managing the business logic.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect with the database and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
MySQL or SQLite for storing student and room data in a relational database.
Swing or JavaFX for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
